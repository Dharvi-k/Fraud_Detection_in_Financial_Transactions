## 🚀 Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions
📌 Project Overview

Fraudulent transactions pose a significant risk to financial institutions, leading to revenue loss, reputational damage, and reduced customer trust. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can proactively detect fraud in real-time transaction data.

The dataset contains 6.3M+ rows and 10 columns, which will be analyzed, cleaned, and used to train a predictive model.

🛠️ Approach

* Data Understanding – Explore dataset structure, imbalance, and data types.

* Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, outliers, encoding, and scaling.

* EDA – Fraud vs. non-fraud comparison, amount distribution, time-series patterns.

* Model Building – Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

* Evaluation – Use Recall, Precision, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix.

* Interpretation – Identify key predictors of fraud.

* Action Plan – Recommend fraud-prevention measures and monitoring strategies.
